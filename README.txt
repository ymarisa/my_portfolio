Notes
    - I looked at a few templates using a jumbotron. Some put a div class=container inside the jumbotron, and some put it outside.
        - the difference is: is the jumbotron in the container (which has padding) or is the container in the jubmotron (stretches to fit)
    - Difference in templates from bootstrap v3 vs bootstrap v4
    - jumbotron right corner is rounded wtf
